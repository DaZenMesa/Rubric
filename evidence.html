          ties together a 10 year story with 21 films before it. The writers have worked hard and long to satisfy the audeience, just as
        a writer must suply all the right commentary and evidence to create something meaningfull and impactful just as Avengers Endgame.</th>

          a 3 might lack some strength in commentary or the evidence behind it. This movie lacks the excitement
        to be an awsome thrill ride. It is solid and great but like a 3 its not perfect and could be improved.</th>

            and producers tried to make this movie and succeeded. There was a plan to make a super hero movie
          and they made one. Like a 2 which has the essentails of commentary and evdience and is a good start but lacks in something substansial and great.

            fails to even make sense. It has a short-coming of creativity and was uninspired as well as lacked content. Writing and making a movie
          takes thought. You need to have content in a movie like you have commentary in an essay, without these your movie and your writing will fail.  </th>

            even try if you are just going to make something filed with nonsense and that has no structure
          or any coherant commentary at all. Simply nothing at all. Did the writer even read the source material? This movie is
        like a peice of writing that is off topic and does not relate to the subject what so ever, while not having a sliver of commentary. </th>
